# Active Record TV Land Lab

## Learning Goals

- Create and modify tables using Active Record migrations
- Build associations between models using Active Record macros

## Introduction

In this lab, we'll be working with a TV show domain model. We will have a show,
network, and character model. They will be associated in the following way:

- An actor has many characters and has many shows through characters.
- A character belongs to an actor and belongs to a show.
- A show has many characters and has many actors through characters.

Here's what the completed ERD will look like after you've created the additional
migrations:

We've given you a few migrations in the `db/migrate` directory to create the
networks and shows table, but you'll have to add additional tables and modify
these existing tables as per the guidelines below.

## Instructions

**Note**: This lab is test-driven, but in order for the tests to run correctly,
you need to complete **all** of the migration files before running `learn test`.
The first three migration files have been done already. You only need to work on
the `004`, `005` and `006` migrations.

Once you've completed the migrations and have the first set of tests passing,
work on building out methods in the classes. Make sure to use the Active Record
association macros like `has_many` and `belongs_to`. Remember, using these
macros creates **instance methods** on your classes, so to pass some of the
tests, the macros will be enough! You'll also have to write out some custom
methods as well.

### Migrations

#### 004_create_actors

Write a migration to create the `actors` table. An actor should have a
`first_name` and a `last_name` as strings.

#### 005_create_characters

Write a migration to create the `characters` table. A character should have a
`name` (string), `actor_id` (integer), and a `show_id` (integer).

A character will belong to a show (the show migration is already provided) and
an actor, and we'll keep track of this relationship with these database table
columns.

#### 006_add_catchphrase_to_characters

Write a migration that adds the column `catchphrase` as a string to your
`characters` table.

**Once you've completed all three migrations, go ahead and run `learn test` to
see what you need to do for the models.**

### Model Methods

#### Character

- `#actor`: should return the actor instance this character belongs to.
  **Hint**: is there an association macro you can use to create this method?
- `#show`: should return the show instance this character belongs to. **Hint**:
  is there an association macro you can use to create this method?
- `#say_that_thing_you_say`: Define a method in the `Character` class,
  `#say_that_thing_you_say`, using a given character's catchphrase. Using Tyrion
  as an example again, the returned string should look like the following:

  ```ruby
  tyrion.catchphrase = 'A Lannister always pays his debts'
  tyrion.say_that_thing_you_say
  #=> 'Tyrion Lannister always says: A Lannister always pays his debts'
  ```

#### Actor

- `#characters`: an actor has many characters, so write code that creates an
  instance method that will return all the characters that the actor has played.
  **Hint**: is there an association macro you can use to create this method?
- `#shows`: an actor should have many characters and many shows through
  characters. Write code that creates an instance method that returns all the
  shows for the actor. **Hint**: is there an association macro you can use to
  create this method?
- `#full_name`: Write a method in the `Actor` class, `#full_name`, that returns
  the first and last name of an actor.
- `#list_roles`: Write a method in the `Actor` class, `#list_roles`, that lists
  all of the characters that actor has alongside the show that the character is
  in.

  So, for instance:

  ```ruby
  peter = Actor.create(first_name: "Peter", last_name: "Dinklage")
  thrones = Show.create(name: "Game of Thrones")
  tyrion = Character.create(name: "Tyrion Lannister", actor_id: peter.id, show_id: thrones.id)

  peter.list_roles
  # ['Tyrion Lannister - Game of Thrones']
  ```

  Notice that when we run `peter.list_roles`, we get an Array containing a
  string with both the character and the show.

#### Show

- `#characters`: should return a list of all the character instances associated with
  the show.
- `#network`: should return the network instance this show belongs to
- `#actors_list`: Define a method in the `Show` class called `#actors_list` that
  returns an Array of the full names of each actor associated with a show.
  Remember, a show should have many actors through characters. **Hint**: it may
  help to use another association macro to access the actors for the show.

#### Network

- `#shows`: should return a list of all the show instances associated with
  the network.
- `#sorry`: returns a string "We're sorry about passing on John Mulaney's
  pilot".
